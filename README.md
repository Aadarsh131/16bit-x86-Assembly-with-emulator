The 8086 is called as the first modern processor because everything in the 8086, such as the general registers AX, BX, CX, DX, and control registers such as CS and IP, are still present in the same processor, for instance, i5 in my laptop. Since 8086, core functions remain unchanged and remain compatible, so we are learning 8086

The * operator in C has become [] in the assembly language. To be precise, [] is inherited from C language to *. Do you know that? The C language was created to make a language that is a bit easier for the assembly language programmer, but more powerful and flexible. So after you study assembly language, C language will look different. You will become a human compiler, you will see what assembly instructions correspond to C language code. It's becoming Neo of the Matrix.
